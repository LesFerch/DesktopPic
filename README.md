# Summary

DesktopPic provides two convenient methods to display one or more pictures on your Windows desktop...

**Method 1: Slideshow**

Displays one or more pictures in a movable, resizable window that has no borders or captions, so all you see is the picture. This will give the illusion of the picture being part of your wallpaper, but it's really just another window. Any desktop icons in the same region as the picture will be covered. Bitmap image formats, such as PNG (recommended), JPG, BMP, and animated GIFs are supported.

![SlideshowExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026235/161466468-306353b4-1b48-464d-8a33-3280cba01116.gif)

**Method 2: Stamp Image to Wallpaper**

One or more images can be stamped to the wallpaper in any size or position. This makes the picture part of the wallpaper, so it will never be on top of anything else and will require nothing to be left running. Images can only be stamped to the primary display, but it's easy to temporarily change the primary display using ⊞-P so that images can be stamped on the wallpaper for any monitor. Images with a transparent background are supported.

**Notes**:
- You can run multiple copies of DesktopPic to have more than one slideshow on your desktop (on any monitor).
- DesktopPic always maintains the original picture's aspect ratio.
- DesktopPic does not do a full screen slideshow (that capability is already built into Windows 7 and above).
- The Stamp feature provides the same result as if you edited your wallpaper using an image editing program. It just makes the process easier and more fun.
- The Stamp feature is multi-monitor aware on Windows 8 and above.

# How to Use (Slideshow)

**Notes**:

- If only one image file is in the same folder as DesktopPic, it will show that one image as long as DesktopPic is running. If more than one image is in the folder, DesktopPic will cycle through the images, showing each one for the number of seconds that has been set (5 seconds is the default).

- The slideshow can be paused by pressing any one of **left arrow**, **right arrow**, **spacebar**, or **backspace**.

- You can manually cycle *forward* through the images by pressing **right arrow** or **spacebar** and *backward* by pressing **left arrow** or **backspace**.

- Pressing **Enter** resumes the slideshow.

## Step 1: Show the Interface

Press **Esc** to show the DesktopPic interface.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026235/165211902-10156f45-22e3-4e7c-a8dc-76834e6dbf7e.png)

**Note**: If **Esc** doesn't activate the interface, DesktoPic probably doesn't have focus. Just click once on the current slideshow image and then press **Esc**.

## Step 2: Select Interface Language

If Windows is set to a language that DesktopPic supports, that language should get selected automatically. The desired language can also be selected from the language dropdown menu.

## Step 3: Move and Resize

Once the interface is displayed, you can drag and resize the DesktopPic window like any other window.

You can also select **Centered** from the **Window Position** dropdown menu to have the slideshow centered.

Coordinates may also be entered in the **Window Position** input box to position the window. For example, **0,0** will position the DesktopPic window at the upper-left corner of the primary display. These numbers change automatically when you drag move the window.

The DesktopPic window size can also be changed by directly entering a value for **Max percent of screen area**. This number represents the maximum amount of your screen area that will be used by the DesktopPic window. This number changes automatically when you drag resize the window.

**Notes**:
- Any entered values take effect when you **Tab** to another field, any time you click on the currently displayed image, and when you click the **Continue** button (or press **Enter**).
- Clicking on the currently displayed image also automatically readjusts the DesktopPic window size to match the aspect ratio of the currently displayed picture. 

## Step 3: Adjust the Slideshow Delay

Change the value for **Pic delay in seconds** to the number of seconds you want each picture to be dislpayed.

## Step 4: Adjust Remaining Preferences

- Check **Run on startup** if you want DesktopPic to run when you login. This feature is supported for multiple copies of DesktopPic *without* any need to rename the **DesktopPic.hta** file.

- Check **Bring to front on start** if you want DesktoPic to come to the front of all other windows when it's launched. This setting does not *keep* DesktopPic in front. It just affects how it starts.

- Check **Stretch smaller pictures** if you want images, that are smaller than the current DesktopPic window, to be stretched to the size of DesktopPic window.

- Check **Display file names** if you want the image file name displayed.

## Step 5: Continue the Slideshow

Press the **Continue** button or press **Enter** to hide the interface and continue the slideshow. All setting changes are automatically saved to a **DesktopPic.ini** file.

**Note**: All setting changes are also saved whenever you click on the currently displayed image while the DesktopPic interface is displayed.

# How to Use (Stamp Image)

These instructions assume you have reviewed the **Slideshow** instructions above and already have an understanding of the interface.

## Step 1: Show the Interface

If the interface isn't currently displayed, press **Esc**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026235/165212129-0421228f-6112-4111-bdfd-92f77943385a.png)

**Note**: While the interface is displayed, **F3** will open File Explorer to the current DesktopPic folder (location of slideshow images) and **F4** will open File Explorer to the DesktopPic local AppData folder (location of stamped wallpaper images).

## Step 2: Select the Desired Picture to Stamp

Use your keyboard **left** and **right** arrows (or **spacebar** and **backspace**) to select a picture to stamp.

## Step 3: Move and Resize

- Drag the DesktopPic window to where you want to stamp the image.
- Resize the DesktopPic window to the image size you wish to stamp.
- Click once on the image to correct the DesktopPic window size to the image's aspect ratio.

## Step 4: Stamp the Image

Click the **Stamp** button to stamp the image to the current desktop wallpaper.

If desired, repeat steps 2-4 to stamp more images.

**Notes**:
- Click the **Restore** button to restore the *unstamped* wallpaper.
- If you click **Restore** by accident, just **right-click** your desktop wallpaper, select **Personalize**, and reselect your stamped wallpaper.
- To stamp an image on the wallpaper for another monitor, press ⊞-P to change the primary monitor, stamp as desired, and then use ⊞-P again to switch back to an extended desktop.

## Step 5: Exit DesktopPic

Click **X** to close DesktopPic.
